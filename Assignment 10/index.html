            <p>The <b>Cloud Native Computing</b> program prepares the students to program in open source
                technologies like,<b> Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</b>
                while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development
                techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.

            <p>The <b>artificial intelligence</b> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI
                technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <b>Python, Numpy, Pandas,
                Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</b> and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and
                ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
